## Problem Statement - Design & Develop

Consider that you are getting events in the format `[{“event1”:{“attr1”: value }}]` from different APIs.
1.  How will you parse the event to get the value?
2.  How will you return 10 latest events when required?

## Seting up the Project

To start with the project:

Create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

Finally, to deploy your stack to AWS.

```
$ cdk deploy
```

And if you have multiple AWS account configured then you need to pass the `--profile` parameter.

```
$ cdk deploy <PipelineStackName> --profile username
```

## AWS services used in this project

This project requires follwing services to run

- AWS Lambda
- IAM Role
- DynamoDB
- CloudFormation
- API Gateway

## API Gateway Endpoint Methods
In this project, we have created **REST API with AWS API Gateway** backed by **Lambda**.

API Gateway will generate URL which will be used to send HTTP requests at. Following method can be used to send request to this URL generated by API Gateway:

* **POST**

User can send the **POST** request to any of these URLs
>- https://some-url/prod/url-01
>- https://some-url/prod/url-02
>- https://some-url/prod/url-03

Data needs to be in the body in a `JSON` format

```
# For /url-01
{
    "data": [
        {
            "arg": 14,
            "path": "/url-01"
        }
    ]
}


# For /url-02
{
    "data": [
        {
            "arg": 29,
            "path": "/url-02"
        },
        {
            "arg": 31,
            "path": "/url-02"
        },
        {
            "arg": 48,
            "path": "/url-02"
        }
    ]
}


# For /url-03
{
    "data": [
        {
            "arg": 67,
            "path": "/url-03"
        },
        {
            "arg": 88,
            "path": "/url-03"
        }
    ]
}
```
