Stuxnet is a notorious malware that is widely considered to be one of the most sophisticated and dangerous cyberattacks in history. Discovered in 2010, Stuxnet was designed to target industrial control systems (ICS), particularly those used in Iran's nuclear program. The malware was able to infiltrate and manipulate Siemens programmable logic controllers (PLCs) to cause physical damage to centrifuges used in uranium enrichment. Stuxnet was a highly targeted and carefully crafted attack, using a combination of multiple zero-day exploits and other advanced techniques. The Stuxnet malware has since become a significant case study in the field of cybersecurity and has led to increased awareness of the potential for cyberattacks to cause physical damage.
