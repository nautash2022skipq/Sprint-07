Phishing attacks are a type of cyber attack that involves the use of fraudulent emails, websites, or other digital communication to deceive users into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or other personal information. Phishing attacks typically use social engineering techniques to trick victims into believing that the attacker is a trustworthy entity. Once the attacker obtains the victim's information, they can use it for fraudulent activities such as identity theft, financial fraud, or unauthorized access to sensitive information. To prevent phishing attacks, users should be cautious when opening emails or clicking on links from unknown sources, verify the authenticity of the website or sender, and use security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software.
