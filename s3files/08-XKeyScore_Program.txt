XKeyScore is a top-secret computer program used by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) to search and analyze global internet data. It was first revealed to the public in 2013 by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. XKeyScore is capable of searching and analyzing vast amounts of internet traffic including emails, chats, and browsing histories, and is believed to be able to target individuals for surveillance even if they are not suspected of any wrongdoing. The program has been highly controversial due to concerns about government surveillance and privacy violations. However, the NSA has defended XKeyScore, stating that it is used for legitimate national security purposes and subject to oversight and legal safeguards.
