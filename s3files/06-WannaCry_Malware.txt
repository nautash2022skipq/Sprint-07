WannaCry is a ransomware attack that first emerged in May 2017 and quickly spread across the globe, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. The malware was able to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, which allowed it to spread rapidly through networks without the need for user interaction. Once infected, the malware encrypted the victim's files and demanded payment in exchange for a decryption key. The scale and speed of the WannaCry attack made it one of the most damaging cyberattacks in history, and it led to renewed efforts to improve cybersecurity and protect against similar attacks in the future.
