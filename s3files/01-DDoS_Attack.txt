A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic from multiple sources. The purpose of a DDoS attack is to make the targeted website or online service unavailable to users, causing significant financial and reputational damages to the targeted organization. Hackers can use various methods such as botnets, amplification attacks, and application layer attacks to conduct a DDoS attack. To mitigate the risk of a DDoS attack, organizations need to have robust security measures in place, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and content delivery networks (CDNs), to prevent and mitigate the impact of such attacks.
