Shodan is a search engine designed to locate Internet-connected devices and systems. Unlike traditional search engines that search for text-based content, Shodan searches for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, servers, and other connected devices. Shodan can identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in internet-connected devices that can be used for cyberattacks. It can be used for research purposes as well, helping companies and organizations to locate their assets and identify any potential risks or vulnerabilities. While Shodan can be a useful tool for cybersecurity professionals, it can also be used maliciously by cybercriminals to find and exploit vulnerabilities in internet-connected devices.
